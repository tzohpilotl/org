#+TITLE: Unit Tests In React

* Context
** Unit Tests Benefits
- Ensure code correctness at the lowest level
- Prevents bug regressions
- Makes code coverage look cool ðŸ˜Ž
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Unit testing is the first tool programmers have to ensure the correctness of
their programs.
#+END_NOTES
** Unit Tests Definition
What makes a unit test a unit test is its scope:

Unit tests should only test one unit a time.
#+BEGIN_NOTES
A unit is a diffuse term but it usually refers to a function or a class. A good
unit test proves the outcome of the unit under test is correct for all it's
logic branches, and for the relevant inputs. Fortunately, reaping the benefits
of unit testing is not hard because the latest developments in technology make
writing unit tests easy.
#+END_NOTES
* Unit Tests Scope In React
- Keep in mind the React component ultimate purpose: to generate HTML code
- A component is a unit
#+BEGIN_NOTES
As in every kind application, React apps benefit from having unit tests, but
they come with their own set of complications. What's generally accepted though,
is that a React component, especially if it's simple as in markup-only
components, but even if it's complex, with state management, children, and
network calls, is an unit. With the exception of higher-order-components,
something we should always keep in mind while testing is a component's
fundamental /purpose/: to generate HTML code. This means that all that state
handling, network calling, and children bearing, will ultimately result in a
tree of HTML tags ready to be rendered by the browser.
#+END_NOTES
* Testing State vs Testing Outcomes
When developing unit tests there are two common approaches:
Testing state and testing outcomes.
** Testing A Unit's State
Testing state is the practice of querying the state of the unit at a given
moment of time. In React, this can be seen in tests that assert the props and/or
the state of the component is what we expect it to be at interesting points in
time, for example, when a component is rendered for the first time, or when a
button has been clicked.
#+BEGIN_SRC js :results output :tangle test.js
  const assert = require('assert/strict');

  function createCounter() {
      let state = { count: 0 };
      return {
          state,
          onClick() {
              state.count += 1;
          },
          render() {
              return `<p>Clicked ${state.count}</p>`;
          },
      };
  }

  const counter = createCounter();

  assert.equal(counter.state.count, 0);
  
  counter.onClick();

  assert.equal(counter.state.count, 1);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_NOTES
My guess is we do this because when we debug we usually make sure the state is
correct step by step during the execution of our program.

What happens if we change the type of ~state.count~?
What happens if we change ~state.count~ for ~state.clicks~?
What happens if we pass the count as parameter (prop) instead of storing it as
state?
What happens if we change the word "Clicked" for "Clidkec" in the render method?
#+END_NOTES
** Testing A Unit's Purpose
Testing outcomes refers to the practice of testing a unit delivers the outcomes
it's designed to deliver. In React, this means we should test a component
delivers the desired HTML code given a known context.
#+BEGIN_SRC js
  const assert = require('assert/strict');

  function createCounter() {
      let state = { count: 0 };
      return {
          state,
          onClick() {
              state.count += 1;
          },
          render() {
              return `<p>Clicked ${state.count}</p>`;
          },
      };
  }

  function getInnerText(html) {
      return html.replace(/\<p\>|\<\/p\>/gi, '');
  }

  const counter = createCounter();

  assert.equal(getInnerText(counter.render()), `Clicked 0`);

  counter.onClick();

  assert.equal(getInnerText(counter.render()), `Clicked 1`);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: undefined
** Test Value
The value of a test has to be proposed case by case, it depends on the unit's
purpose.

Let's examine the ~counter~ component.
#+BEGIN_SRC js
  function createCounter() {
      let state = { count: 0 };
      return {
          state,
          onClick() {
              state.count += 1;
          },
          render() {
              return `<p>Clicked ${state.count}</p>`;
          },
      };
  }
#+END_SRC
From the source code, we can tell that the counter component's output is some
HTML code that includes the number of times its ~onClick~ callback has been
called, but in the end, the component's expected /outcome/ is this:

to show a user how many times the counter has been clicked.

Note that neither the fact that the counter comes from state or props, nor if
the text is displayed inside a paragraph or a list item matters to the end user.
** Test Robustness
For every testing approach (testing a unit's state and testing a unit's
purpose), ask the following questions:

- What happens if we change the type of ~state.count~?
- What happens if we change ~state.count~ for ~state.clicks~?
- What happens if we pass the count as parameter (prop) instead of storing it as state?
- What happens if we change the word "Clicked" for "Clidkec" in the render method?
 
In general, test robustness increases when we test outcomes instead of state.
